This is a small website that was made to host the files and provide some information.

The website was made using the Django framework, and a guide I used to setup the webserver on a Digital Ocean instance can be found [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-django-with-postgres-nginx-and-gunicorn-on-ubuntu-18-04).

The main website files are in `wormholeweb/template/wormholeweb`. The rest is mostly Django boiler plate to fit the project.
